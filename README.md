# Experimental geometry processing library in Rust

This repository is used to develop features for the 
[tri-mesh](https://crates.io/crates/tri-mesh) crate. 
This means that the features in `geo-proc` are experimental 
and it is highly recomended to use the [tri-mesh](https://crates.io/crates/tri-mesh) crate instead!
